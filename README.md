# Rock Paper Scissors – A Tiny Javascript Project

This project marks the beginning of my hands-on journey into **JavaScript fundamentals**.

 Through this project, I focused on:
- Writing reusable logic using functions
- Applying conditional statements (`if / else`)
- Understanding basic control flow and game logic
- Connecting JavaScript behavior with HTML user interactions
